What I Planned on Doing:

I initially set out to complete several parts for my project. The first task was to finish the "My Journey" page, to describe the process of installing the tools for this class. Along with that, I aimed to finalize the "About" page, where I added pictures and cool information about myself. Additionally, I planned to develop a fun "cookie clicker" game as an interactive element and add some information about basketball to my website, since it's a topic I find interesting and relevant.

What I Actually Did:

I accomplished all of my planned tasks and more. Besides completing my "My Journey" and "About" pages, and successfully building the cookie clicker game, I added a substantial amount of new content. I integrated four Jupyter notebooks: one for the JavaScript hacks, a Python notebook with the emojize code, a basketball-related notebook, and an "About Me" notebook, where I listed 8 fun facts about me. I also created a Spotify page that links to popular songs from each decade (70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s), added a snake game, developed an iTunes API page, and implemented a number systems calculator. I ended up adding a lot more content due to personal interests and additional project requirements made along the way.
