<h3>Striverr<h3>

At N@TM, I went to a project called Striverr, with features like Hobbies, a Step Tracker, and Quotes with the purpose of empowering growth and celebrating achievements. I liked the applications of Striverr in the real world since many people could use this to improve themselves. I suggested to improve their styling a bit, and add different functions for admins and users, which would make the site more secure.

<h3>Own Project/Feature</h3>

I was able to present my feature at N@TM to many people, describing how Packing Portal gives packing recommendations to users for their trip and demoing the functionality.
<br>
<br>

Through a google form, our entire group got feedback on our presentation and website. Here are the results:
<br>
<br>

- 4.42 - How unique was our project?
<br>
- 3.92 - How attractive was our website design?
<br>
- 4.42 - How easy was it to follow along to our presentation?
<br>
- 4.67 - How well did we serve the purpose of simplified traveling?
<br>
<br>
One specific piece of feedback I got was:
<br>
<br>
"You should be able to add your own packing items instead of only being able to select items that are given."
<br>
<br>
In order to improve, I can follow this feedback and add this functionality to my feature.
