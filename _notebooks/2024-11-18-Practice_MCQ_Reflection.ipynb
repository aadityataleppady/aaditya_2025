    "A. One thing I learned from this quiz is how to think critically and understand code that is presented to me. I also learned about different concepts in computer science and how they are applied to problem solving. Finally, I learned a lot of theoretical knowledge such as abstraction, pseudocode, and the internet, which has practical applications in technology and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. I feel weaker on questions involving theoretical knowledge of computer science. Specifically, I had some trouble on questions relating to the internet because I had not learned about those concepts before. To improve my skills on these questions, I can learn and study more about theoretical knowledge of computer science.\n",

    "The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom right square of the grid and facing toward the top of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following programs are each intended to move the robot to the gray square. Program II uses the procedure One word, Goal Reached, which returns true if the robot is in the gray square and returns false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements is true?\n",
    "```\n",
    "My response: B\n",
    "Correct Answer: C\n",
    "Explanation: Program I also correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The two code segments below are each intended to display the average of the numbers in the list One word, num List. Assume that One word, num List contains more than one value.\n",

    "```\n",
    "My response: B\n",
    "Correct Answer: A\n",
    "Explanation: The number of steps of the algorithm is a polynomial, so the algorithm runs in reasonable time.\n",
