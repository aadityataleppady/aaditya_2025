    "In the beginning of Sprint 2, after the formation of our teams, we made our lessons for Python and JavaScript. My group did the 3.1 and 3.4 lessons. I did the popcorn hacks, and my group did the rest. In  3.1, we went over variables, such as the naming conventions and different types of variables in Python and Javascript. In 3.4, we went over strings in Python and Javascript. In addition, the highlight of our lesson was the quiz embedded into our lesson page, making the lesson interactive. For the other groups' lessons, we did the popcorn hacks in class, and did the homework after. After the lessons, I learnt a lot about arrays, if statements, mathematical operations, and logical operators in both Python and Javascript. Now, in my code, I use if statements, arrays, and booleans, making my code better. Also, I created a blog with notes from each lesson, which will help me remember different topics and help me on the AP test. These concepts would help me in the college board AP tests and project-based learning. This would help me in the college board AP test because, after the lessons, I now know a lot about Python and Javascript. Specifically, I learnt how to manipulate the data inside arrays in both Python and Javascript. Also, I learnt how to use JSON in both Python and Javascript. In addition, I did not have problems with the homework and my code was good, showing that I learnt a lot from the lessons. I spent a lot of time and effort on the homework and popcorn hacks, which would eventually benefit me in the college board AP test.\n",
